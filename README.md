# AFOMS
Ankle-Foot-Orthosis Misalignment Simulator

Cases the AFOMS should cover:

Default Files: Default_Data folder > Default data from Fakoorian of 5 participants for all motions present
  1. Can run simulation for -20 to 20 (angle range customizable) with typical input for misalignments
  2. Can run simulation for -20 to 20 (angle range customizable) with graphical input for misalignments
  3. Can run simulation for a specific individual > for a specific motion type > for a specific trial of that motion type > for a specific limit of cells in excel sheet as well for whole
  4. Can run simulations for all individuals for all motions for all trials (run by default)

External Files:
  1. If only anatomical data is given -> run simulation for -20 to 20 (angle range customizable) with typical input for misalignments
  2. If only anatomical data is given -> run simulation for -20 to 20 (angle range customizable) with graphical input for misalignments
  3. External_Data folder > Data (anatomical + motion data) is given -> run simulation for a specific individual > for a specific trial of that motion type > for a specific limit of cells in excel sheet as well for whole
  4. External_Data folder > Data (anatomical + motion data) is given -> run simulations for all individuals for all trials (run by default)
